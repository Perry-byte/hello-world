Simple, trial repository that will be used to practice and understand the basic development of a Git project

My name is Perry. I'm really interested in applications development like this but I feel like I'm a hopeless beginner sometimes. I hope to get into games development, one day, and am trying to learn as much as I can, to hopefully set up a career path to that.
